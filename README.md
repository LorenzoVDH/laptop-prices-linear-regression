I want to understand how today’s Artificial Intelligence systems work, not just at the surface level, but at their core. Rather than simply using AI tools, I want to explore the underlying mechanisms and algorithms that power them. Although my ultimate goal is to pursue a more bio-inspired approach to AI, I understand the importance of first mastering the common practices and foundational concepts in AI and ML.
I’m still new to advanced math, and diving into it has been challenging. However, I’m not one to shy away from difficult concepts. This document is my way of organizing my thoughts and building a clear, structured understanding of these foundational ideas, both in theory and in practice. My goal is to demonstrate my commitment to mastering complex concepts and to show my willingness to confront challenges head-on.
My first attempt was to create a neural network capable of recognizing numbers from 0 to 9 using the MNIST training set, all from scratch without relying on extensive frameworks. However, I quickly realized that I needed a stronger foundation in certain underlying concepts. Which then led me to shift my focus towards more fundamental projects like this one, to build a solid understanding before tackling more complex topics. 
Everything here is written based on my own research, I did not use any pre-written material or tutorials for this.
